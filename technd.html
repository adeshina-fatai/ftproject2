                      <p>A brake is a mechanical device which inhibits motion. Brakes are generally applied to rotating axles or wheels, but may also take other forms such as the surface of a moving fluid (flaps deployed into water or air). Some vehicles use a combination of braking mechanisms, such as drag racing cars with both wheel brakes. An automotive braking system is a group of mechanical, electronic and hydraulically activated components which use friction / heat to stop a moving vehicle. The purpose of the braking system is either to reduce the speed of the vehicle or to bring it to rest. It converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle to heat energy by means of friction.</p>

                      <h2>Brake Components</h2>
                      <img            src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1Lf2DpR/break.png" alt="Break Components">
                      <p>Break Functions</p>
                      <p>A disc brake system usually consists of brake disc rotor, 2 brake pads and a caliper. The combination of these components allows the rotating wheel to experience severe braking in a short stopping distance. The braking surface is the area on which the braking action of the friction material takes place. The centre part of the brake disc has a circular aperture, which is located on the wheel hub. It is surrounded by a number of holes for the wheel bolts. The brake disc rotates along with the wheel. The normal load, produced when the brake is actuated result in the generation of an in-plane friction force at the disc pad interface. This in turn produces a brake torque about the centre of rotation of the wheel. The reaction to the brake torque is seen in the brake force, between the tire and ground, which slow the vehicle.</p> 
                      <p>The ventilated brake disc is a one-piece casting with the grooves and for passenger vehicle with cooling fins between the two braking surfaces. This enables air to circulate between the braking surfaces, making them less sensitive to heat build-up and more resistant to fade. Dirt and water do not generally affect the braking action since contaminants are thrown off by the centrifugal action of the brake disc or scraped off by the pads. In addition, the equal clamping action of the two brake pads tends to ensure uniform, straight line stops.</p>
                      <p>The two main functions of the brake rotor are the transmission of mechanical force and the dissipation of heat, produced when functioning at both medium and high temperature. This means that the materials used for brake discs must be able to support high temperature. The rotor material must be cost effective, allowing for potential reduction in weight as well as for the stability of the components.</p> 
                      <p>A solid disc brake consists of a rubbing surface and a top hat section. The section that connects these two parts is known as the neck. The rubbing surface section is the area where a tangential friction force is generated when the disc interacts with a stationary pad to stop the moving vehicle. The disc rubbing surface area is sometimes known as the cheek. A top hat section is connected to the disc rubbing surface and mounted to the vehicle wheel hub.</p>
                      <p>A disc brake which has separate in-board and out-boards rubbing surfaces with cooling vanes or fins in between is known as a ventilated rotor. These vanes allow the air to flow through the structure and cool the rubbing surfaces during and after all braking events. There are two types of ventilated disc; front-vented type and back-vented.</p> 
                      <p>The friction between the pad and disc plats a decisive role in defining the amount of the brake pad is designed to rub against the disc surface leading to diminution of pedal force required to obtain a given rate of deceleration. This factor is also important in designing brakes for the balanced operation of a vehicle as brake imbalance lead to a yaw torque about the vehicle that could compromise the vehicle stability. The additional task for the brake disc is to induce air movement, as air moving over the rubbing surface of the disc reduces the heat buildup.</p> 
                      <p>The brake pad is designed to rub against the disc surface leading to diminution of vehicle speed, thereby converting mechanical work into thermal energy. The structure of the pads can be very complex.</p>
                      <p>The caliper, which contains one or more pistons, holds the two brake pads on either side of the rotor. The movement of the pistons is controlled by a hydraulic system. When hydraulic pressure is applied by pressing the brake pedal, the piston is pushed forward to press the inner pad against the rotor while the housing is pushed in the opposite direction to press the outer pad against the rotor, hence generating a hydraulic clamp around the rotor. For the fixed (non-floating) caliper type of disc brake system, each piston presses the brake pad against its respective side of the brake rubbing surface. Meanwhile the floating caliper housing, which is designed to slide on its support, reacts by shifting and pushing the pads against both sides of the disc.</p>
                   <p>Drum Brakes are comprised of a drum & backing plate, a  hub or axle assembly, brake shoes , wheel cylinder, wheel bearings and hardware necessary to mount these components on the vehicle.  The wheel cylinder is connected to the master cylinder through tubes, hoses and valves that conduct brake fluid through the system.</p>

                      <hr>
                      <p> Hydraulic brake system work on the principle of Pascal’s law which state that “pressure at a point in a fluid is equal in all directions in space”. When the brake pedal is depressed, the pressure on the brake pedal moves a piston in the master cylinder, forcing the brake fluid from the master cylinder through the brake lines and flexible hoses to the calipers and wheel cylinders. The force applied to the brake pedal produces a proportional force on each of the pistons.
                  The calipers and wheel cylinders contain pistons, which are connected to a disc brake pad or brake shoe. Each output piston pushes the attached friction material against the surface of the rotor or wall of the brake drum, thus slowing down the rotation of the wheel.  When pressure on the pedal is released, the pads and shoes return to their released positions. This action forces the brake fluid back through the flexible hose and tubing to the master cylinder.</p>

                      <h2>Master Cylinder</h2>
                      <p>The master cylinder is use to convert the applied pedal force into pressure in a fluid system. It increases an existing pressure and also permit s the free passage of fluid to and from the system until the cylinder is operated.</p>

                      <h2>Operation of a master cylinder</h2>
                      <p>When the pedal is depressed, it acts on the master cylinder pushrod. The pushrod pushes up the cylinder bore against the light resistance of the spring. As the piston travels up the cylinder, the cup washer seal closes off the passage between the fluid reservoir and the cylinder. This prevents fluid leaving the cylinder through that passage. Instead it pushes upwards and out through the check valve into the hydraulic pipes. The fluid is not pumped or pressurized but displaced under pressure. The movement of the fluid in the cylinder pushes up the rest of the fluid. The fluid at the far end operates the wheel cylinders. When the drivers foot is taken off the brake pedal the spring returns the piston and the pushrod back to where they were, i.e. the bottom end of their travel. Therefore, the pressure is taken off the brake fluid. The springs on the brake shoes return the displaced fluid taken from the brake fluid. Any loss of fluid in the system is topped up by the reservoir.</p>
